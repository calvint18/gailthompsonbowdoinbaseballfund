<div class="divider">What is the Gail Thompson Foundation?</div>

<div class="about">
  <div class="about-text">
  The Gail Thompson Fund is an initiative led by the Bowdoin Baseball team focused on raising awareness and funding to support 
  families fighting Alzheimer’s disease, accelerating research for a cure impacting future generations, and maximizing quality 
  care and support. Cal Thompson, a sophomore outfielder, has a 77-year-old grandmother currently battling Alzheimer’s disease.
   Having experienced the chaos and stress of taking care of, living with, and visiting an individual with Alzheimer’s he wants to advocate for 
   support to the Alzheimer’s community. To make Cal’s dream come true, we have joined with the Alzheimer’s Association and will 
   be participating in the Walk to End Alzheimer’s on October 5th at the Maine Street Mall & Gazebo in downtown Brunswick. Taking
    it a step further, and mostly to help our team get in shape (finally), the team will be running 1 mile for every $100 donated 
    until the end of October. Help the boys get in shape, and fight Alzheimer’s one mile at a time, by donating now!

                We believe in the power of guidance and giving. Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s is a journey that is 
                both challenging and overwhelming. Family caregivers often face immense emotional and physical strain, 
                putting them at “greater risk for anxiety, depression, and poorer quality of life than caregivers of 
                people with other conditions” (CDC). Having gone through this process myself, especially as Alzheimer’s 
                rapidly affected my grandmother, I experienced firsthand the intense stress and confusion that comes with 
                watching a loved one struggle. The emotional turmoil, the uncertainty of making the right decisions for 
                Gail’s care, and the constant demands were truly overwhelming. It felt like living in a state of chaos. 
                By supporting us today, you can help guide families through these difficult times and provide them with 
                the support they so desperately need.

                At the heart of every community lies the strength to advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves. 
                Alzheimer’s disease is not just a diagnosis; it’s a devastating journey that strips away memories, independence,
                 and the essence of those we love. As the number of affected individuals continues to rise, so does the need for
                  awareness, support, and research funding. Watching my grandmother slowly lose pieces of herself to this 
                  relentless disease was heart-wrenching, leaving my family feeling powerless and overwhelmed. However, 
                  through advocacy, we found a voice—not just for her, but for all families navigating this painful path. 
                  Your donation can empower others, providing the resources and hope needed to fight this battle. Run with us
                   in advocating for a future where Alzheimer’s is a memory, not a reality.

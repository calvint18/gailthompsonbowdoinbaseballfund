                <div class="lb-meaning-text"> The leaderboard is a fun way of showing how the running is being distributed throughout the team. See how many miles your favorite, 
                    or least favorite, Polar Bear has! An alternative way to track the running done by the Polar Bears is to visit our teams <a>instagram page</a> where we 
                    will post updates about how many miles we run, who did the running, and how much money is being raised to support Alzheimer’s. The goal of this section is
                    to motivate donors/supporters to keep up with the team throughout this fundraiser. Just as those struggling with Alzheimer’s need 
                    to be surrounded with a loving community, we too are looking to build a strong community of caring and engaged individuals to keep this foundation going for years to come.
